        <h3 class>HOW TO PLAY</h3>
        <p class="text"><li>To start off playing, select the numbers/rows/sections/categories you wish to play for by clicking on them. When you select a category, it will turn blue indicating that it has been selected. To undo the selection, simply double-click on the numbers/rows/sections/categories and they will be deselected.</li></p>
        <p class="text"><li>Then click on the "Click for lucky number" button in the bottom right corner of the table, which will generate the random lucky number.</li></p>
        <p class="text"><li>Once this is done, you will be able to see on the basis of what number is generated, how you have fared and how many points you have earned.</li></p>
        <p class="text"><li>The points system works like this:
          <ul>
            <li><u>Numbers from 0-36:</u> 36 points each (if selected and your number matches the Lucky number)</li>
            <li><u>1st-3rd Row:</u> 3 points each (if selected and your number lies within the row of the Lucky number)</li>
            <li><u>1-12/13-24/25-36:</u> 3 points each (if selected and your number lies within any of the ranges that the Lucky number is in)</li>
            <li><u>1-18/Even/Red/Black/Odd/19-36:</u> 2 points each (if selected and your number lies within any of the ranges that the Lucky number is in)</li>
          </ul></li></p>
        <p class="text"><li>To continue with the same numbers after the first round, you can keep pressing the "Click for lucky number" button, until you run out of points and you can select new ones if you wish to.</li></p>
        <p class="text"><li>The "Win/Loss for current round" shows you how many points you have won or lost in the current round (that is after one click of the "click for lucky number" option) before you can continue playing the game</li></p>
        <p class="text"><li>To start a new game, simply click on the "New Game" option located on the game information page.</li></p>
